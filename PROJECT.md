# Developer Testing Assistant Kit

## Project Overview

An internal productivity tool that leverages Claude Code CLI and Claude Desktop to automatically generate and execute ephemeral testing scenarios based on GitHub PRs and Jira tickets. No permanent test cases are created - everything is dynamically generated and executed on-the-fly.

## Architecture

### Core Components
```
Developer Machine
├── Claude Code (CLI orchestrator)
│   ├── GitHub integration (built-in)
│   ├── MCP servers management
│   └── Test scenario generation
└── Claude Desktop (test executor)
    └── Desktop automation (screen control)
```

### Technical Stack

**Claude Code (CLI) - The Brain**
- **GitHub API integration**: Built-in PR analysis and diff processing
- **MCP server coordination**: Manages Jira and Confluence data gathering
- **Test scenario generation**: Analyzes code changes + business context
- **Execution coordination**: Orchestrates with Claude Desktop
- **QA Notes Output**: Prints comprehensive testing notes to console

**Claude Desktop - The Hands**
- **Desktop automation**: Mouse/keyboard control for all platforms
- **Screen capture**: Screenshots and video recording during tests
- **Application interaction**: Web browsers, desktop apps, CLI terminals
- **Real-time execution**: Runs generated scenarios immediately

**MCP Server (Deno/TypeScript) - Unified**
```
mcp-servers/
└── atlassian-mcp/
    └── server.ts            # Unified Jira + Confluence integration
                            # Uses single Atlassian API token
                            # Built with Deno for modern runtime
```

## Data Flow

### Context Gathering Chain
1. **GitHub PR** → Extract PR URL, diff, changed files
2. **Jira Ticket** → Follow PR → Jira ticket linkage
3. **Tech Breakdown** → Follow Jira → Confluence tech breakdown
4. **Help Documentation** → Fallback to product help pages with screenshots/videos

### Execution Flow
1. **Developer Trigger**: `claude-code test-pr <pr-url>`
2. **Claude Code Analysis**:
   - Fetches PR diffs and metadata via GitHub API
   - Queries MCP servers for Jira context and Confluence documentation
   - Generates ephemeral test scenarios based on code changes + business context
3. **Claude Desktop Execution**:
   - Receives test scenarios from Claude Code
   - Takes desktop control to execute tests across platforms
   - Captures screenshots and videos during execution
4. **QA Notes Output**: Claude Code prints comprehensive testing notes to console

    └── mcp-server                     # MCP server executable
```

### Setup Script Capabilities
- Configure API credentials for GitHub/Atlassian (unified token)
- Test connectivity to all services (GitHub, Jira, Confluence)
- Compile executables for deployment
- Validate prerequisites (Deno, Git)
- Create secure configuration files

## Developer Workflow

### Daily Usage
```bash
# Analyze and test a specific PR
deno task start test-pr https://github.com/company/repo/pull/123

# Test current branch PR (auto-detect)
deno task start test-current-pr

# Test with specific focus areas
deno task start test-pr <url> --focus="authentication,payment-flow"

# Or use compiled executable
deno task build
./dist/tap test-pr <url>
```

### Output Format
```
=== QA Testing Notes ===
PR: https://github.com/company/repo/pull/123
Jira: PROJ-456 - Add user authentication flow
Tech Breakdown: Authentication Service Design

Code Changes Analyzed:
- Modified: src/auth/login.rs
- Added: src/auth/session.rs
- Updated: tests/auth_tests.rs

Test Scenarios Executed:
✅ 1. User login with valid credentials
   - Opened browser to login page
   - Entered test credentials
   - Verified successful login redirect
   - Screenshot: login_success_20240815_143022.png

✅ 2. Session management validation
   - Verified session token creation
   - Tested session timeout behavior
   - Confirmed logout functionality
   - Video: session_flow_20240815_143045.mp4

⚠️ 3. Error handling for invalid credentials
   - Found minor UI issue: error message positioning
   - Functionality works correctly
   - Screenshot: error_state_20240815_143112.png

Recommendations:
- Consider fixing error message positioning in login form
- All core functionality working as expected
- Ready for QA team review
